      What is the main character in sample_images/quixote.tex ?
    images_settings:
      width: 500
      height: 300
    answers:
      # the correct answer
      perfect: Don Quixote
      # the wrong (to different extents) ones
      wrong:
        # if a list, the 1st element is the (wrong) answer, and the 2nd one the percentage of the total grade it yields
        - [Sancho Panza, 90]
        - [Dulcinea del Toboso, 10]
        # no credit is given for this answer
        - Some guy
        - $\frac{2}{3}$
        - It should be on the cover of sample_images/quixote.tex
    feedback: |
      if you look at the cover of sample_images/quixote.tex
      you know, well...you know...you know you know....
